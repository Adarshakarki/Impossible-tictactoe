# Impossible Tic-Tac-Toe
A high-stakes, dark-mode Tic-Tac-Toe game where the Bot literally cannot lose. The game masquerades as a standard 3x3 match, but if the player manages to reach a draw, the grid "glitches" and expands to a 5xtimes 5$ layout, allowing the Bot to claim an instant victory from the hidden outer ring.

## Features
* Automatically detects a draw in the 3x3 area and expands the board to reveal hidden cells.
* Perfect AI: Uses a priority-based logic (Win > Block > Center) to ensure the player never has an easy path to victory.
* Dynamic Visuals: Features a vibrant Lime Green highlight color and a thick Red Strike Line that cuts perfectly through winning symbols.
* Responsive Dark Mode: Optimized for both desktop and mobile with a sleek GitHub-style dark aesthetic and rounded corners.
* Precision Graphics: Uses SVG coordinates to ensure the winning strike line is never offset, regardless of screen size.
